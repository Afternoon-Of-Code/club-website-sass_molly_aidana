# About
Hi! My name is Hemani and I am a Computer Science and Economics double major who’s passionate about creating spaces where women can thrive in business and tech. 


As Co-President of WiBE, I want to help build a community that supports mentorship, growth, and genuine connection. I joined the board because I care about empowering women to see their potential, build their confidence, and step into leadership with boldness.
